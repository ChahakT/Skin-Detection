# Skin-Detection

The appearance of skin in an image depends on the illumination conditions (illumination geometry and color) where the image was captured. Therefore, an
important challenge in skin detection is to represent the color in a way that is invariant or at least in sensitive to changes in illumination. The choice of the color space affects greatly the performance of any skin detector and its sensitivity to change in illumination conditions.

The human skin color has a restricted range of hues and is not deeply saturated, since
the appearance of skin is formed by a combination of blood (red) and melanin (brown,
yellow). Therefore, the human skin color does not fall randomly in a given color space,
but clustered at a small area in the color space. But it is not the same for all the color
spaces. Variety of color spaces have been used in skin detection literature with the aim
of finding a color space where the skin color is invariant to illumination conditions. The
choice of the color spaces affects the shape of the skin class, which affects the
detection process.

A different class of color spaces are the orthogonal color spaces used in TV
transmission. This includes YUV, YIQ, and YCbCr . YIQ is used in NTSC TV broadcasting
while YCbCr is used in JPEG image compression and MPEG video compression.All these
color spaces separate the illumination channel (Y) from two orthogonal chrominance
channels (UV,YIQ, YCbCr ). Therefore, unlike RGB, the location of the skin color in the
chrominance channels will not be affected by changing the intensity of the
illumination

**Training Pseudocode**


train_s = list for (RGB, YCC,HSV values) skin pixels in training set


train_ns = list for non skin pixels in training set


Loop for all images in training set:


Give path; Read the original image; Read the ground truth image


Threshold the ground truth image to make skin pixels white and rest black


Read height, width, channels in original image


Loop for all pixels in Image in raster scan manner:


Read BGR pixel value; Convert to appropriate colour space; Write converted values to a list

If (pixel classification =skin):Append 1 Else: Append 0

Define mean of numbers; Define standard deviation of numbers

Define summarize: It calculates Mean and Variance of each attribute in dataset
summaries =Dictionary to contain mean and variance of all components in both
training and test set.

summaries[0]= summarize(train_s); summaries[1]= summarize(train_ns)
